<p class="padding">We hope future versions of this app will help you talk to your friends about the problems and questions they have to deal with while continuing to dynamically connect to community resources as appropriate. I do not know all the concerns that you are facing. I am constantly troubled by the seriousness and sometimes life-threatening problems that young adults face. Therefore, we would like your help to know which concerns to provide responses to. This can be done in two ways. First, you could read the scenarios that other teens have shared and like those you want to see responded to (like 1 or all of them). Second, share some of the questions youâ€™ve been asked or had yourself. Try not to include any information that might give away who asked the question and trust that all information will be kept completely confidential and all questions will be adapted or combined with others to insure complete privacy.</p>
